## Basic Concepts

### What is Shorting?

Shorting is a technique used to bet on a price decline of an asset. Unlike going long (buying assets to benefit from price increases), shorting benefits from price decreases. 

### Reasons to Short

1. **Speculation:** Betting on price drops to profit, akin to day trading.
2. **Delta Neutral:** Advanced trading strategy not covered here.
3. **Avoid Taxable Events:** Shorting can help avoid triggering taxable events in some jurisdictions.
4. **Hedging:** Protecting against potential losses in your portfolio.

### Hedging with Shorting

Hedging involves taking an offsetting position to protect against potential losses. It’s important not to hedge more than 100% of your portfolio value. 

#### Benefits of Hedging

- **No Need to Sell Crypto:** Avoids taxable events and market timing risks.
- **Protects Portfolio:** Helps mitigate losses without selling assets.

### When to Hedge

- **During Downtrends:** Ideal in bear markets with a positive risk-to-reward ratio.
- **Ending Bull Trends:** Useful in sustained sideways trends post-bull market.

### When Not to Hedge

- **Lack of Understanding:** Avoid if you don’t understand leverage derivatives.
- **Profit Intentions:** Shorting to hedge is for loss mitigation, not profit-making.
- **Inability to Afford Losses:** Hedge with funds you can afford to lose.
- **Strong Uptrend:** Shorting in a strong uptrend can be costly.

## Methods Available

1. **Perpetual Futures Contracts:** Popular for shorting, with no expiration dates and periodic funding rates.
2. **Traditional Margin Trading:** Involves borrowing assets from the exchange.
3. **Traditional Futures Contracts:** Includes expiration dates and premiums/discounts.
4. **Option Strategies:** Buying put options may be inefficient in crypto markets.

## Major Concepts and Definitions

1. **Perpetual Futures:** Designed to act like real assets with no expiration dates.
2. **Funding Fee:** Deducted periodically from your margin.
3. **Margin:** Reserved amount of balance to open a position.
4. **Leverage:** Determines position size and liquidation price.
5. **Isolated vs. Cross Margin:** Isolated limits risk to the reserved amount; cross margin risks the entire balance.
6. **Limit vs. Market Orders:** Use market orders for faste
